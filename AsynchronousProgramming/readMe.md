# Tips and Tricks to Remember

- **Async programming** lets you multitask without blocking the rest of your code.
- **Event loop** ensures that JavaScript keeps running tasks one after another and doesn't get stuck.
- **Callback hell** is a problem when you have too many nested callbacks. To avoid it, use **promises**!
- **Promises** are like a way to say, “I’ll finish later,” and give you a way to handle the result.
- **Async/Await** makes promises easier to work with by allowing you to "pause" and wait for results.

# Cheat Sheet 📝

- **Callback Hell**: Avoid nesting → use promises or async/await.
- **Promises**: `.then()` for success, `.catch()` for errors.
- **Async/Await**: Write async code like it’s synchronous.
- **Event Loop**: JavaScript’s way of juggling tasks efficiently.
